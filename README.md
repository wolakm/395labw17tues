# 395labw17tues

## This is the demo repo from CMPT395's intro git lab

You will learn the following
- forking a repo
- cloning a repo to get a local copy
- making changes
- using `git add` and `git commit` to commit changes
- using `git push` to share your changes

But the fun is just beginning, after the above you'll learn to
- create pull requests to suggest changes
- merge pull requests from other team members
- add an upstream repo
- use `git fetch` and `git merge` to incorporate their changes

Oh the fun!!!
